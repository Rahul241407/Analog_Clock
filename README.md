# Analog Clock using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## Project Description

This project is a simple yet elegant analog clock created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The clock displays the current time in an analog format with smooth and dynamic movement for the hour, minute, and second hands. It's a great demonstration of how to use basic web technologies to create interactive and visually appealing elements.

## Features

- **Real-Time Clock**: The analog clock updates in real time, reflecting the current local time with accurate second, minute, and hour hand movements.
- **Responsive Design**: The clock is designed to be responsive and adaptable to different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent appearance on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Custom Styling**: The clock face and hands are styled using CSS, allowing for easy customization and enhancement of visual elements.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Provides the basic structure of the clock.
- **CSS**: Used for styling the clock, including the layout and visual appearance of the clock face and hands.
- **JavaScript**: Implements the functionality to update the clock hands in real time based on the current time.
